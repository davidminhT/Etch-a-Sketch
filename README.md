### Assignment
- Create an "Etch a sketch" digital drawing pad.
- The canvas size is allocated a constant area of pixels that doesn't change even if Grid Size is changed.
- User change change the grid size through a prompt button.

### Goals
- User should be able to control the site through keyboard inputs.
- Multiple options for colors that user can choose from through a color picker.
- Color intensity slider which adjust the strength of the drawn color.
- Instead of a prompt button to change the Grid Size, use a slider instead.
- Make the site pleasing to look at.
- Make the drawing aspect engaging to user by adding special effects. This would also help the user know which box is being affected.
- Have indicators for which keys is being pressed to prevent confusion.

### Challenges & What I Learned
- Using git to organize my project into multiple experimental branches when I'm implementing new features.
- I found it difficult to organize the HTML elements in a way that would work for flexboxes as well as for Javascript references. This project allowed me to see many different scenarios where class and id can be useful.
- I learned how to manage website events propagation and bubbling by implementing a grid of divs that each has its own corresponding event listeners.
- Implementing the usage of keys to control my website helped me learn to combine events and tasks as well as how to use these events effectively.
